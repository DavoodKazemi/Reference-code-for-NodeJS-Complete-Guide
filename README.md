# Reference Code for NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)

This repository contains code I wrote while following along with the [NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. 

This repository is for educational purposes. The code is for my personal reference, as it contains some extensive comments in the code and commits description. So it could be useful for other people who use this video course too.
